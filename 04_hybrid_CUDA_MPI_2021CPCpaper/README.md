This repository for the publication (A hybrid MPI-CUDA approach for nonequispaced discrete Fourier transformation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465520302393)) includes two parts: the source code and the input data for the validation of the proposed computational scheme.## Source code- `cunfft.cu` is used to transfer input data from host (CPU) to device (GPU), compute NDFT in device, and thereafter fetch computational results from device to host. `cunfft.h` is the relelatd head file.- `util.c` and `util.h` are used for the benchmark.- `Makefile` contains commands for the hybrid CUDA-MPI compilation scheme, and an executable file named `CUDA_MPI_TEST` will be available after the correct compilation.
